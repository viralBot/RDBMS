# RDBMS

This is a pure C++ project that aims to emulate the fundamental commands found in a relational database management system.

# Key Features:

• Menu-driven interface, eliminating the need for a graphical user interface (GUI) or any resource-intensive foreground processes.
• Supports essential operations such as creating, deleting, and renaming tables, in a single database.
• Enables operations like adding to and selecting from a relation.
• Facilitates operations such as union, difference, Cartesian product, and natural join between two relations.
• Enables projection of a relation based on a specified set of columns.
• Utilizes a text interface to ensure the clear formatting and printing of relations.
